            <h1>About<span> Me</span></h1>
            <p>As an enthusiastic Web Developer, I have more than two years of practical expertise in web development
                and possess a diverse range of skills in various technologies like e-commerce, SQL, full-stack
                development, database design, and content management systems (CMS). Furthermore, I am enrolled in a
                Postgraduate Diploma program in Web Development at Conestoga College. I am gaining practical knowledge
                in Project Management, advanced database management, and responsive web design.</p>

            <p>During my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong work ethic and refined my
                problem-solving skills, allowing me to produce outstanding results within specified timelines. As a
                dedicated team player, I prioritize time management, project management, effective communication, and
                adaptability. I strive to work collaboratively with my colleagues and clients to accomplish shared
                goals. Additionally, I continuously seek ways to improve my skills by learning new programming languages
                and volunteering at community events.</p>

            <p>My passion for web development and technology has consistently driven me to pursue a career in this
                field. I am committed to achieving exceptional results using my technical knowledge and teamwork
                abilities. My critical and creative thinking skills and attention to detail allow me to tackle complex
                problems and develop efficient solutions for various projects. I am a reliable and trustworthy
                individual who can work independently or as part of a team. Moreover, my excellent interpersonal skills
                enable me to communicate effectively with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders.</p>

            </div>
            <aside>I have learned a diverse set of languages and frameworks. PHP and Laravel enable server-side web
                development, while JS, HTML, and CSS are essential for client-side programming. WordPress helps create
                dynamic websites, and MySQL allows efficient database management. Lastly, React enhances the development
                of interactive user interfaces.</aside>

                    <p>The library management system is a Web application that I developed as my final year college
                        project. I took on the challenge of creating the entire project on my own, with some assistance
                        from the internet when needed. To build this system, I utilized various technologies such as PHP
                        for the backend logic, MYSQL for the database management, and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                        Bootstrap for the user interface design.</p>

                    <p>During my time as a PHP developer at Welpel Info Company, I developed a product import platform
                        that streamlined the process and included features such as product upload, order placement,
                        order approval, secure payment integration, reporting, and other essential functionalities. This
                        project enhanced my skills and contributed to the company's success.</p>

                    <h2>WordPress-Laravel Code Canyon Project</h2>
                    <p>In addition to my experience at Welpel Info Company, I also worked as a freelance WordPress
                        developer on Upwork. One of my notable projects on CodeCanyon involved setting up and validating
                        a payment gateway on a WordPress site. This payment gateway allowed users to purchase a service
                        related to a Laravel project. Additionally, I was responsible for setting up the Laravel project
                        itself, ensuring its proper functioning and integration with the WordPress site. This freelance
                        experience allowed me to further expand my skills in WordPress development and Laravel
                        integration.</p>
